## Development

### Getting Started
You should install all dependencies on both front end and back end.
To do this, **you need to be on the Back end folder and Front End folder** and type this command:

 ``` cmd
         npm install
 ```
You are going to do this twice.

### Running the Application
You should Run the backend and the front end at the same time. The group did not create a short-cut script to run both at the same time so you will need to go to the specific folder and run each by doing
 ``` cmd
         npm start
 ```
Remember that **you should run do this twice on both Back end folder and Front End folder**
